# LyricAnalysis27Club
In recent years, many of our favorite artists have been telling stories of their mental states as well as personal stories. Rapper Mac Miller wrote about his drug usage, which foreshadowed his death in 2018. Mac Miller, Lil Peep, Avicii, and Chester Bennington are just some contemporary artists whose personal struggles (expressed through their music) and untimely demises have created shockwaves across the industry. But this trend has roots in incidents that reach back to at least the 1970’s, with the formation of the infamous 27 Club. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and many others have contributed in creating an almost cult-like reverence for the tragic ending of a musician’s life via their own demons and vices. The struggles of modern musicians and the long history of overlooking their underlying issues inspired us to look at whether or not lyrical analysis of their works and activities can help predict self-harm behavior for artists in the future.
